## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS


### What I learned


I learned to use the stylesheet and set new property within it `document.styleSheets[1].cssRules[12].style.transform = 'rotate(180deg)'` to reach a `::after` element. 

Set a new `svg` with innerHTML.


### Continued development

Learning from each challenge, I will continue to make website with JS and learning from different challenge from Front-end Mentor.


### Useful resources

- [Mozilla mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Very useful.
